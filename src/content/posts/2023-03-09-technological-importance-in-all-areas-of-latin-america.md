R﻿ural and remote suburban areas are known to be the areas that do not get much importance when it comes to Internet access. These areas are also dead spots for how Internet signal is very weak to how remote they're located on a map. At the same time, the amount of students who live in these areas that don't own a device is prominent and are not receiving the proper share in those who live in towns, cities, and even large cities who get their own devices.



T﻿he large focus point would be how allocating educational resources to all areas of a country is ensuring equity and fairness of educational opportunities for students and improving the performance of education systems. There has been a difference in how high-performing countries in Latin America have allocated more equitable resources to their education systems than semi-high-performing and low-performing countries. These two types of countries share more of their resources with advantaged schools than disadvantaged schools, bringing a negative outlook to the unfair distribution they're seen doing.
