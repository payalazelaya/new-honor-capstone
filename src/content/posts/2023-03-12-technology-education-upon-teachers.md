T﻿eachers are the backbone of student support when it comes to education, but they are the ones to provide reliability when it comes to understanding technology and how it functions so students can use it for in-class and out-of-class learning. Yet, what's hard to know is that a majority of teachers are not given proper technology training to acquire skills that can help their students out with technological questions or problems. 

T﻿his is why ICT (Information and Communication Technology) skills training comes in handy since this is how teachers are able to use these skills in their classrooms for students to be engaged on their devices as well. It's shown that only receiving training on how to use ICT skills for teaching isn't sufficient enough in supporting students' learning in an era of digital learning through tech. The driving factor in how teachers use ICT skills is how prepared they felt afterward from receiving training in professional development in ICT skills for teaching sessions.
