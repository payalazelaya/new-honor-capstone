S﻿tudents over the last couple of years have been provided with devices for their educational use while being at home, yet the impact this has is shown to be worthy of how more engaging they are with their education. In general, digitalization is hopeful in bringing in the possibility of new social inclusion opportunities in the region after sustaining the progress it has established in promoting the movement in the past two decades.

S﻿tudents across the region are accessing ICT (Information and Communication Technology) at younger ages because of schools influencing the need for digital tech to be introduced to them for their learning and exploration of new concepts. In particular witht he rapid digitalization seen over the last decade, it's influenced how students are learning, doing homework, interacting with classmates, and spending leisure time. 

E﻿ven from a young age, the trend of children exposed to technology has increased due to at what age they accessed a technological device for the first time. This exposure to technological devices demonstrates an increase in Internet usage at schools doubling between 2012 to 2018 for 15 year old students and their Internet usage outside of school also  jumped from 1 and a half hours to 3 hours or 3 and a half hours for weekdays and weekends is significant.
