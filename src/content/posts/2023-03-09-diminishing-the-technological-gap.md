  all age groups, including students "

S﻿tudents over the last couple of years have been provided with devices for their educational use while being at home, yet the impact this has is shown to be worthy of how more engaging they are with their education. In general, digitalization is hopeful in bringing in the possibility of new social inclusion opportunities in the region after sustaining the progress it has established in promoting the movement in the past two decades.

S﻿tudents across the region are accessing ICT (Information and Communication Technology) at younger ages because of schools influencing the need for digital tech to be introduced to them for their learning and exploration of new concepts. In particular witht he rapid digitalization seen over the last decade, it's influenced how students are learning, doing homework, interacting with classmates, and spending leisure time. 

E﻿ven from a young age, the trend of children exposed to technology has increased due to at what age they accessed a technological device for the first time. This exposure to technological devices demonstrates an increase in Internet usage at schools doubling in numbers between 2012 to 2018 for 15 year old students and their Internet usage outside of school also jumping from 1 and a half hours to 3 hours or 3 and a half hours for weekdays and weekends alone. These factors, though, depend on the country that children come from that has made accessing technology accessible for them like Chile and Uruguay for example. These countries in 2018 reported that 75% of 15-year-olds accessed technology for the first time in comparison to 50% of the same age group but in Mexico and the Dominican Republic. Yet, when comparing to other OECD countries, the other countries' statistics showed only less than 1% of 15-year-olds hadn't used a device, meaning that the majority are already familiar with tech, in contrary to Latin America and the Caribbean where the statistic is more than 2%. 

M﻿any factors contribute to why Latin America and the Caribbean face this situation, which most of them are covered more in the other blogs of the website. To touch briefly upon them, most of these factors consist of physical barriers, proper tech-based training, allocating resources to all areas of a country to maintain educational equity, and much more.
