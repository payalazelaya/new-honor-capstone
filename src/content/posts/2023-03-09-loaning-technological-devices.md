E﻿ducation technology has taken over how opportunities and chances for new experiences for students in Latin America have opened, are achievable, and are promising for their futures. The growth of interest in ed-tech throughout the region has been prevalent, thus it's a critical time to support governments and other contributors in the decision-making process of implementing the program to assist in the execution of real changes in students' learning. At the same time, its growing attention has even inspired reasonings for acquiring key findings and recommendations to support the validity of a frequently conversed claim it is. 

T﻿o elaborate a bit on the timeline of the region, over the past year, 2022 to be exact, it's been established that a decade has focused on increasing education technology in Latin America along with the Caribbean. Companies that focus on concepts related to education technology also have arisen within the decade, producing a number of jobs within the framework of 21st-century skills mixed with tech. Within the decade too, COVID-19 occurred within the region just like everywhere else worldwide, where it threw off the stability of most structural sections and was hit the hardest while having the longest effects by it. Here's where education technology comes in entering the door being one of the most impactful components of growth in the region for increasing the access and resources for parents, mentors, teachers, and schools, followed by slowly diminishing the existing gender inequality gap as well.

T﻿hough, there's been instability in how much funding ed-tech goes to the sections of pre-K, K-12, colleges/universities, and the workforce within the past decade.  With unequal values in funding, pre-K remains the section to have the least funding from education and it affects how this age group can be introduced to technology and how it can guide their educational path in the future. Following the pre-K section is the K-12 section which also experiences the same circumstances as also having inconsistent funding in education technology, even though it's the next largest and fastest-growing section of students to change the future. On the other hand, strong growth in funding for higher education a year after COVID occurred due to universities looking for ways for students to learn digitally within hybrid or remote settings.
